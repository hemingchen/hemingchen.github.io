        </h1>

        <p>I’m currently working at Hitachi America, Ltd as a Researcher. My primary research project is to develop a distributed, concurrent and automated cloud computing platform for simulating complex mechatronic systems.</p>

        <p>I received my Bachelor’s degree in 2006 from <a href="http://www.buaa.edu.cn">Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics</a> (known as Beihang University now), Master’s degree in 2010 and Ph.D in 2012 from University of Minnesota.</p>

        <p>My M.S. and Ph.D. studies were advised by <a href="http://www.aem.umn.edu/people/faculty/bio/zhao.shtml">Professor Yiyuan J. Zhao</a> at <a href="http://www.aem.umn.edu/index.shtml">Department of Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics (AEM), University of Minnesota (UMN)</a>. My research was focusing on Air Traffic Management (ATM) system design and simulation, including airport traffic management, aircraft collision alerting algorithm, aircraft conflict resolution strategy, and environmental friendly aircraft trajectory optimization. My Ph.D. thesis presented complex optimization algorithms in managing airport traffic at both tactical and strategic levels.</p>
